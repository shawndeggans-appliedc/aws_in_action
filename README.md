## Overview
I'm starting my hands-on morning practice with this AWS book. I selected it, because like many books I'll use in this practice, it encourages hands-on work. We will be working in AWS. We won't cover everything, but that's ok, it's enough to get our hands active and to get some projects developed. I'm creating a repository for it right now, so I have a basic set of coding tools to work with.

## Notes

#### Chapter 1
Chapter 1 is a general introduction to AWS that succinctly defines the nature of the cloud and the market offerings of AWS. The first use case examined is a Web Shop owner who wants to lift-and-and shift from an on-premises data center to AWS. The authors point out the advantages of employing additional services for resiliency and greater efficiency.

The second use case is Maureen who needs to migrate an enterprise Java application to AWS. The focus on this use case is the security a virtual network provides the organization and the reduction in overhead for overall control.

The third use case is for Alexa, who works on at a startup. The focus here is on a highly available system managed through a load balancer and redundant systems. 

The forth illustration is Nick, who needs to process a large amount of data, but do it on a small budget. He does this by taking advantage of spot instances and the ability to start and stop a virtual machine on command. 

Much of the rest of this chapter is a focus on AWS as a cloud service, breaking down exactly what AWS offers users. I'm not attempting to necessarily capture that type of information in these notes, so I'll skip capture much more from Chapter 1.

Here's the chapter summary:
Cloud computing, or the cloud, is a metaphor for supply and consumption of IT resources.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

AWS is a platform of web services for computing, storing, and networking that work well together.

Cost savings aren’t the only benefit of using AWS. You’ll also profit from an innovative and fast-growing platform with flexible capacity, fault-tolerant services, and a worldwide infrastructure.

Almost any use case can be implemented on AWS, whether it’s a widely used web application or a specialized enterprise application with an advanced networking setup.

You can interact with AWS in many different ways. Control the different services by using the web-based user interface, use code to manage AWS programmatically from the command line or SDKs, or use blueprints to set up, modify, or delete your infrastructure on AWS.

Pay-per-use is the pricing model for AWS services. Computing power, storage, and networking services are billed similarly to electricity.

To create an AWS account, all you need is a telephone number and a credit card.

Creating budget alerts allows you to keep track of your AWS bill and get notified whenever you exceed the Free Tier.
